## React Comment Component

## What is this project?
This project was me learning react for the first time, I started with function components (without hooks) just passing in props. I made a reusable comment section component which can be reused in future projects. 

## What I learnt?
1. Basic function components - the react sytnax for function components, passing in props to JSX.
2. JSX - how it is initialised, the react syntax/good practice using JSX (e.g. `className=`).
3. How to add free css to a React project- Semantic UI.
4. Faker.js - adding faker.js into our project and using its data we need (e.g. avatar images).

## What technologies I Used?
1. React
2. Semantic UI
3. Faker.js
